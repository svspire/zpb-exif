Don't use #'parse-exif-data. That function is only for compatibility
with a similarly-named function in exifinfo.cl, and it doesn't
return all the data that zpb-exif finds.

Instead, in order to see everything that zpb-exif can find in an
image file, do
(zpb-exif:exif-alist (zpb-exif:make-exif <filename>))


You may see "Unknown Tag #x8769" in the output. This is the EXIF-offset
tag and it tells the offset of the exif IFD itself, which presumably
zpb-exif deduces on its own. Thus it can safely be ignored.

Good links to EXIF specs are at

Note that after you process or edit an image with software tools, some
or all of the exif tags may not be copied into the output. It's normal
to find a lot more exif tags in the original camera image than in an
output edited image. Some tools may copy some of the exif tags (like
the DateTime tag, for example), but might not include all the camera-maker
specific tags.
